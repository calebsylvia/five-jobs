# 5 Jobs that Interest Me
# Make a simple webpage that shows 5 jobs I am interested in 
# Peer Reviewer: Zahid Afsar
# Peer Review: The website looks good and all the buttons function well. A couple of suggestions I would like to say is to make a navbar or even a back button for the pages so the user can go back to the home page. Also maybe add the jobs benefits from the company. Overall I say you did good and can make it improve with these suggestions.
